# Economic Mechanics
In Physics the concepts of position (POS), velocity (VEL), and acceleration (ACC) are pretty essential to the basic mechanics of motion. Things also "move" in economies and having a mechanics model of that motion could add some clarity to higher level questions like "Is the middle class shrinking?", "Is this purchase risky?", "How am I changing with respect to a changing world?", "How tolerant to risk am I?", and the like. Asking questions with numbers usually makes getting reliable answers easier, and knowing the words to use to phrase that question gives us a mental scaffolding that helps make sense of the complicated reality of economics. 

## 1. Economic Position
$$  
EP = \frac{NetWorth}{GDP}  
$$  

## 2. Economic Velocity
$$  
EV = \delta EP = \frac{ \delta NetWorth}{ \delta GDP}  
$$  

## 3. Economic Acceleration
$$  
EA = \delta EV
$$  

## Usage
App runs out of a docker container, so use run.sh to run the application "standhope.py"
```bash
./run.sh --help
```

## Examples
```bash
